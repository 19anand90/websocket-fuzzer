## Websocket Fuzzer

A simple websocket fuzzer for application penetration testing.

Two tools are provided:

 * `websocket-fuzzer.py`: Receives a websocket message, modifies it, and 
 then sends it in different connections. The response is analyzed to find
 potential vulnerabilities.
 
 * `send-one-message.py`: Sends a websocket message using a new connection

Both tools require considerable customization to be used. Please read the
source code comments in both files to better understand all the parameters.

## Installation and usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

# edit send-one-message.py
python send-one-message.py
```

In most cases you'll want to use a proxy, such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite, to
analyze the websocket traffic generated by these tools. Both tools support
proxying the websocket traffic.

The workflow for these tools is fairly simple:

 * Use `send-one-message.py` to define most of the variables, make sure that
 authentication is working, etc. Confirm all this with the logs and traffic
 seen in the local proxy.
 
 * Move the `send-one-message.py` configuration to `websocket-fuzzer.py` and
 customize the remaining parameters. Start the process and confirm that the
 fuzzer is sending what you expect.
 
 * Customize the payloads which are sent to the target using `payloads/payloads.txt`
 
 * Analyze the logs using `grep` to find specific things you're looking for.
 The tool will try to identify issues for you and log them with `Potential issue 
 found in connection with ID` 

## Authentication

The tools support authenticating using user-defined websocket messages. These
messages are sent before the ones with the payloads.

## Logging

All messages are logged to a user-defined directory. Each connection is logged
to a different file. Detailed logging is very important for this tool, since
it allows the user to run `grep` on the output to find interesting things.

## Fuzzing

The tool was developed for fuzzing websocket applications which use `JSON`
as a serialization method. If this is not the case for you, please customize
the following functions:

    * `create_tokenized_messages`
    * `replace_token_in_json`
